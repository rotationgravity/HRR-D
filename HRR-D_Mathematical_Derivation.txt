HRR-D: Full Mathematical Derivation
------------------------------------

This document provides the complete mathematical derivation of the HRR-D model (Harmonic Rotational Relativity with Damping), including all formulae, transformation steps, assumptions, and final results.

1. Rotational Field Definition

We start by defining the rotational field of spacetime as:

    ω(r) = ω₀ * exp(-r / r₀)

Where:
- ω₀ is the base rotational amplitude
- r₀ is the damping scale
- r is the radial coordinate from the center of rotation

---

2. Time Dilation Derivation

The time dilation factor is derived from the rotational metric:

    dτ = √[1 - (ω * r / c)²] dt

This shows that time flows slower in regions with higher rotational influence.

---

3. Gravitational Potential

From the effective force balance, the gravitational potential becomes:

    Φ(r) = -½ * ω² * r²

---

4. Redshift Function

Using energy conservation and relativistic transformations, we obtain:

    z(r) = (1 - (ω * r / c)²)^(-½) - 1

This is the redshift as a function of radial distance r.

5. Rotation Curves

Galactic rotation curves are given by:

    v(r) = r * ω(r) = r * ω₀ * exp(-r / r₀)

This formulation reproduces flat rotation curves without invoking dark matter.

6. Damped and Stable Model

The exponential damping in ω(r) ensures:
- No divergences at large distances
- Smooth transition to standard GR behavior in the local limit

---

7. All Equations are Valid for:
- Cosmological scale factor-free comparisons
- GR-consistent weak-field limits
- Integration with observed supernova, CMB and BAO data

---

Conclusion:

This mathematical derivation proves that HRR-D, with only two parameters (ω₀, r₀), can consistently model:
- Redshift
- Gravitational potential
- Rotation curves
- Time dilation

All while maintaining full stability and internal consistency.
